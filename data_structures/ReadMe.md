## Linear

| Data Structure | Real-time Examples                               | 
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

|                | 2. A treasure hunt where each clue leads to the next location |
| Stack          | 1. A pile of plates; the last one put on top is the first one to be taken off |
