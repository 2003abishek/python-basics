# Difference between Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)

In General, a Binary Tree allows nodes to be added without any specific order, whereas a Binary Search Tree requires nodes to be inserted and maintained in a sorted manner, making search operations more efficient.

| Feature             | Binary Tree          | Binary Search Tree (BST) |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Node Arrangement**| Any order            | Sorted order             |
| **Search Efficiency**| Generally slower    | Faster                   |
| **Insertion Rule**  | No specific rule     | Left < Parent < Right    |
| **Ordering**        | Not ordered          | Ordered                  |
| **Traversal Outcome**| Not sorted          | In-order gives sorted list |
| **Use Case**        | General purpose      | Search-oriented tasks    |
| **Balancing**       | Not necessarily balanced | May need balancing   |
