# Data Structure in Python

| Data Structure        | Python Data Type or Implementation Note |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Array                 | List (`list`)                           |
| Stack                 | List (`list`) with stack operations (`append` and `pop`) |
| Queue                 | `collections.deque` (double-ended queue) |
| Priority Queue        | `queue.PriorityQueue` or `heapq` module for heap-based priority queues |
| Linked List           | No native type; implement with a class using nodes and pointers |
| Doubly Linked List    | No native type; implement with a class using nodes with two pointers (next and prev) |
| Circular Linked List  | No native type; implement with a class where the last node points back to the first |
| Set                   | Set (`set`)                             |
| Dictionary (Hash Map) | Dictionary (`dict`)                     |
| Tuple                 | Tuple (`tuple`)                         |
| Binary Tree           | No native type; implement with a class for nodes and pointers to child nodes |
| Binary Search Tree    | No native type; implement with a class and ensure ordered insertion and deletion |
| Graph                 | No native type; implement using dictionaries or adjacency lists/matrices |
| Heap (Binary Heap)    | `heapq` (module for heap queue operations) |
| Trie                  | No native type; implement with a class using nodes with a dictionary of children |
| B-Tree                | No native type; implement with a class, multiple child nodes per tree node |
| Red-Black Tree        | No native type; implement with a class, maintaining balancing during insertions and deletions |
| AVL Tree              | No native type; implement with a class, maintaining height balance of nodes |
| Skip List             | No native type; implement with multiple layers of linked lists for faster access |
